# Histogram-of-Oriented-Gradients
Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection. The technique counts occurrences of gradient orientation in localized portions of an image. However, we can also use HOG descriptors for quantifying and representing both shape and texture.
